# BM-Killing-With-Kindness

## Description 
In an time of uncertainly, complacency is more detrimental that it appears to be. Stand up to the rising tide of hate and fight back. Killing them with Kindness is an application that allows for a simple act to do powerful things. This application takes a simple kind message and makes it an instrument of activism. Write a kind message and killing them with kindness sends it to an active list of hate groups in the U.S. By clogging their in-boxes with many kind messages, it puts a delay in their daily routine of spreading hate across the globe. Make your voice heard, send a kind message today.
